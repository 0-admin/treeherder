# Dependencies for building the documentation, intended to be used standalone
# since doc generation does not need all of the requirements in common.txt.
# These are intentionally not version-pinned & have implicit dependencies,
# since otherwise we play tug of war with the Read the Docs build process
# every time they update Sphinx versions. If this file were just for Read the
# Docs, we could omit the Sphinx entry since they provide it, however that
# would not help those who wish to build the docs locally.
